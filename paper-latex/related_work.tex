On the whole, predicting any financial market has proven to be difficult. Simon's work encapsulates many of the inherent problems. Price predictions might accurately predict directionality changes or general trends, but if these predictions consistently lag behind actual prices, they will not be useful despite a low RMSE. Model evaluation therefore must either demonstrate ability to generate profit through a trading scheme or demonstrate an ability to correctly predict directionality for desired trading period times. Simon identifies a training period of 3 years and a test period of 6 months as optimal for reducing predicted errors \cite{forex_neuralnets}.

\noindent In an examination of the potential for technical approaches to predict pricing movements, Gidofalvi found that a 20 minute period before and after the release of financial news allowed for a weak prediction of price movements \cite{gidofalvi2001using}. It was found by McQueen and Roley that fundamental macroeconomic news has little impact on stock prices but that other news types have effects dependent on responses of expected flows relative to equity discount rates \cite{mcqueen1993stock}.\\

\noindent Schumaker and Chen were able to demonstrate 57\% directional accuracy when using news articles to predict S\&P500 stock movements within 20 minute periods \cite{schumaker2009textual}. Bollen et al also achieved an accuracy of 86.7\% when incorporating semantic mood data from Twitter \cite{bollen2011twitter}.

\noindent The work done by Phua et al is important mainly for validating GDELT as a valid news source for market prediction. Their topic analysis shows that GDELT consistently identifies impactful events. Term extraction from news sources is shown to be relevant using concept link exploration. However, Phua et al do find that not all significant events can be distinguished by GDELT. For example, the first riots in Singapore in 40 years did not appear significantly different than other news clusters. They were also unable to verify the quality of semantic score assignments. While they use decision trees to determine the factors potentially useful in price forecasting, they do not attempt to actually forecast prices, which this paper does.
